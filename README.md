# WC3 - West Computing & Cybersecurity Club

This is the main website developed for WC3. It is available at the GH pages for this repository.

## Tech Stack

- Bun for compiling TS files to JS.
- SvelteKit for frontend.
- TailwindCSS for making styles easier.
- TypeScript for solving bugs beforehand.
- Currently (dev stage) using Github actions and pages for website deployment.

## Repository Documentation
The repository uses Bun as a runtime. NodeJS developers that use NPM, Yarn, or PNPM may use their normal JavaScript package manager because Bun should mostly be compatible with those, especially in simple websites like this. Just make sure to not commit the lock files.
