# WC3 - West Computing & Cybersecurity Club

This is the main website developed for WC3. It is available at the GH pages for this repository.

## Tech Stack

- Bun for compiling TS files to JS.
- SvelteKit for frontend.
- TailwindCSS for making styles easier.
- TypeScript for solving bugs beforehand.
- Currently (dev stage) using Github actions and pages for website deployment.

## Repository Documentation
The repository uses Bun as a runtime. NodeJS developers that use NPM, Yarn, or PNPM may use their normal JavaScript package manager because Bun should mostly be compatible with those, especially in simple websites like this. Just make sure to not commit the lock files.

Has the content of the website in a seperate file than the website code. This is because the content is quite long, and so, it is to avoid cluttering the codebase with things like club descriptions, and also makes it easy to track changes such as spelling errors to the site.
